Usability Test: Pathfinder Android Application
Fall, 2015
Pathfinders

Introduction:

Thank you for agreeing to test out Calvin Pathfinder!
We’re testing our app, not you.  You can’t do anything wrong here.  We want to hear exactly 

what you think about the application.  Be honest and don’t worry about hurting our feelings.  

That will help us find problems that exist and will help us fix them.
For the test, we’ll ask you to do certain tasks and we’d like you to think out loud while 

you’re doing them.  If you have questions, just ask.  If you have comments, go ahead and say 

them.  We’ll record your comments, but won’t make them public.  If, for any reason, you’d like 

to quit this test, then just say so.

Background Questions:

Before we begin, do you have any questions for me?
We presume that you’re a Calvin student.

Have you ever gotten lost looking for a test? What’s the hardest building on campus to find?

The Test

1.	Give us your general impression of the main menu. Is it obvious what you can do? Which 

of the two buttons would you like to press?

3.	Navigate from the map page to the destination page.
 

2.	Let’s say you want to find where you are currently on campus. Can you find your 

location?

3.	Can you find the Science Building?




Many thanks for your willingness to help us test Calvin Pathfinder. We’ll contact you soon with 

a summary of what we found and how we hope to use it to improve our app.  We’ll keep the data 

from your individual session private and will only release aggregate data.
