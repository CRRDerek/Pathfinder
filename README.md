Calvin Pathfinder is for Calvin College guests or students who need help finding their way around Calvin's campus. Calvin Pathfinder is a GPS based Android application that will give class directions, building floor views, and a class schedule reminder. Unlike the Calvin College app, our application pinpoints specific rooms on campus along with a pinpointed GPS location of where you are on campus.

It can be very difficult for students to find the room where a certain class will be held for the first time. The same goes for new guests to Calvin like fridays students or guest speakers. Calvin Pathfinder will solve this problem by providing an interactive map that provides an interface to enter a class schedule or room number. The map will direct you to the building where the class is located. It will use GPS to track the userâ€™s location in realtime. Once in the building, the app will display a floor plan with the correct room highlighted for additional guidance.
