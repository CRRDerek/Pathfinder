VISION

New students face difficulty finding where a certain class will be held for the first time. Similarly, new guests at Calvin such as 'Fridays at Calvin' students or guest speakers may not know the location of a room they are expected to find. 

Calvin Pathfinder will solve this problem by providing an interactive map with an interface to enter a class schedule or room number. The map will direct users to the building where a class is located. It will use GPS to track the user’s location in realtime. Once in the building, the app will display a floor plan with the correct room highlighted for additional guidance.

Calvin Pathfinder will be implemented as a GPS based Android application that will give class directions, building floor views, and a class schedule reminder. Unlike the Calvin College app, Calvin Pathfinder pinpoints specific rooms on campus and displays the user's current location.
