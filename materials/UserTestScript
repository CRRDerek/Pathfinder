Usability Test: Pathfinder Android Application
Fall, 2015
Pathfinders


Introduction

Thank you for agreeing to test out Calvin Pathfinder!
We are testing our app, not you. You can’t do anything wrong here. We want to hear exactly what you think about the application. Be honest and don’t worry about hurting our feelings.  

That will help us find problems that exist and will help us fix them. For the test, we will ask you to do certain tasks and we’d like you to think out loud while you’re doing them. If you have questions, just ask. If you have comments, go ahead and say them. We will record your comments, but won’t make them public.  If, for any reason, you’d like to quit this test, then just say so.


Background Questions

We presume that you are a Calvin student and if so what year are you? 

Do you have a smart phone and is it android or apple? Are you familiar with the google maps application on smart phones?

Have you ever been lost on Calvin’s campus or needed to ask for direction?

Before we begin, do you have any questions for me?


The Test

1.	Give us your general impression of the main menu. 

2.	What would you do if you wanted to see where you are at on campus?

3.	What would you do if you decided you wanted to search for a building or room on Calvin’s campus?
 
A.	Try to find your way to Hiemenga Hall.

B.	Since we are in the building what would you do to see a floor plan of the third floor?	

4.	Final observations – Do you have any final observations on the application? Would you consider using this app?


Many thanks for your willingness to help us test Calvin Pathfinder. We’ll contact you soon with a summary of what we found and how we hope to use it to improve our app. We’ll keep the data from your individual session private and will only release aggregate data.
