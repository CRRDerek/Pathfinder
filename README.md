For Calvin College guests or students who need help finding their classes the Calvin Class Finder is a GPS based Android application that will give directions to class. Unlike the Calvin College app, our application pinpoints specific rooms on campus.

Calvin Class Finder is an Android-based map utility primarily intended for students and visitors of Calvin College. It can be very difficult for students to find the room where a certain class will be held for the first time. This is an interactive map that provides an interface to enter a class schedule or room number. The map will direct you to the building where the class takes place. It will use the android device’s GPS to track the user’s location in realtime. Once in the building, the app will display a floor plan with the correct room highlighted for additional guidance.
